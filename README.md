# Exploring Multi-Category Object Detection with Bounding Boxes



## How to use

Launch Jupter lab, open the Pytorch Lightning or FastAI based notebook and run!

## Alternative (Run as Python Standalone Script)

### Prerequisite
* Python 3.8 and pip installed
* Ensure IceVision is installed i.e. pip install icevision
* Which should mean nbdev, jupyter, pytorch-lightning, fastai, pytorch, torchvision, fastcore, numpy ... are all installed

### Optional Generate script
* On command line, run ```nbdev_build_libs```

### Run e.g. FastAI version of Subcoco script
(Look at mcbbox/subcoco_ivf.py to see if that's what you want...)
* Change directory to project level
* On command line, run ```python run_subcoco_ivf.py``` or ```python run_subcoco_pl.py``` 
* Go away for a day or so...
